            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>When I started dropshipping in 2020, SEO was a concept I had heard of but didn’t understand. I relied heavily on paid ads to drive traffic to my store because I didn’t know how to get organic search traffic. It wasn’t until recently that I began to seriously explore SEO, realizing its potential for long-term, cost-effective growth.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="indexing">
            <h2>Understanding Indexing</h2>
            <p>Indexing is the process by which search engines like Google discover, analyze, and store web pages in their database so they can be retrieved in search results. Without proper indexing, even well-optimized content remains invisible to users.</p>
            <p>Through a 2024 indexing study on Black Hat World, I learned about tools like <strong>Linkdexing</strong> and <strong>SmartIndexer</strong>, which help notify search engines about new pages. These services proved valuable for indexing orphaned pages—pages with no internal or external links.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="backlinks">
            <h2>The Importance of Backlinks</h2>
            <p>Backlinks are links from other websites that point to your site. They act as endorsements, signaling to search engines that your content is trustworthy and authoritative. Quality backlinks from relevant, authoritative sites can significantly boost rankings.</p>
            <p>I also learned that anchor text diversity is crucial. Overusing exact-match anchor text can lead to penalties. Instead, varying anchor phrases ensures a natural link profile.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>When I started dropshipping, SEO was a mystery to me. Now, by understanding indexing, backlinks, user intent, and engagement metrics, I’ve built a strategy focused on long-term success. Learning from trusted resources and studies has helped me adapt to modern SEO dynamics and lay the foundation for sustainable growth in my eCommerce business.</p>
